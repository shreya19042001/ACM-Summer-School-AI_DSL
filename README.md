# ACM-Summer-School-AI_DSL

Hi all,I have attended ACM Summer School on **"Compilers for AI/ML"**.
We learnt about the working of Compilers. We created a compiler which converts AI-DSL(Domain Specific Language) to cpp(C++ language).
We worked on lexer(.l)file, yacc(.y) file which helped us to scanning, generating tokens,building AST(abstract syntax tree) and parsing.
